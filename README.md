# openshift-deployment

This repository will hold the configuration files necessary to deploy
the Solar Forecast Arbiter to an Openshif cluster.


``okd_helper.py`` is a script that helps in templating the yaml configuration
files using the Jinja2 templating language. It also supports retrieving
parameters from AWS SSM.
